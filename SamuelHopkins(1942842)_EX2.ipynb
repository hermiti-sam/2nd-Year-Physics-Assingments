    "## Problem: Free-fall with fixed or varying drag\n",
    "On 14th October 2012, Felix Baumgartner set the world record for falling from a great height.  He jumped from a helium balloon at a height of 39045 m, fell for 4 minutes and 19 seconds and reached a maximum speed of 373 m s$^{-1}$. In this problem, you will solve the equations of motion for a free-falling object, and use your program to confirm, or otherwise, Felix Baumgartner's statistics. [In fact Felix BaumGartner's record stood until 24th October 2014, when Alan Eustace (a senior Google vice president) jumped from 41419 m, reaching a maximum speed of 367m s$^{-1}$. A sonic boom was heard by observers on the ground.  However, Eustace's attempt was very low-key compared with Baumgartner, and it is the latter who tends to be remembered.]\n",

Baumgartner jumped from very high altitude, where the air density is very low, and so the drag factor, $k$ should be replaced with a function $k(y)$.  The simplest way to approach this is to make use of the scale height for the atmosphere, $h$, and model the variation of density as an exponential decay:\n",
